# What Is The Inspector (bifrost-eval)?

## The Simple Version

Imagine you hire a team of chefs. They cook meals every day. But how do you know the food is any good?

**Option A:** You taste every dish yourself. Slow, subjective, doesn't scale.

**Option B:** You install a quality testing system — it checks every dish for taste, presentation, cost, and speed. Automatically. Every time.

**The Inspector is Option B, but for AI agents.**

When you build an AI system with multiple agents working together (like our Forge), The Inspector automatically tests them and produces a scorecard:

- **Did the AI get the right answer?** (Like checking if the dish tastes right)
- **Did it use the right tools?** (Like checking if the chef used the right ingredients)
- **How fast was it?** (Like checking if the kitchen served on time)
- **How much did it cost?** (Like checking if the ingredients were within budget)

## Why It Matters

Most people who build AI never measure if it actually works well. They just look at the output and say "yeah, looks fine." That's like running a restaurant and never asking customers if they liked the food.

The Inspector turns "yeah, looks fine" into "93% accuracy, $0.02 per task, 500ms response time, Grade: Excellent."

## The One-Sentence Pitch

"A quality grading system that automatically tests AI agent pipelines and tells you exactly how accurate, fast, and cost-efficient they are."
